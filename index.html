        <h1>Image In Marque</h1>        
        <p>The term "image marque" is often a blend of English and French, commonly referring to a brand’s visual identity or brand image.
             In French, "image de marque" means the public perception of a brand, shaped through its logo, design, messaging, and overall aesthetic. 
             It reflects how customers emotionally connect with a company, influencing loyalty and trust. 
             In digital design or marketing, “image marque” can also refer to branded visuals such as logos, banners, or promotional graphics used to build recognition. 
             Sometimes, it's mistakenly used to refer to “image marquee,” a web design effect where images scroll or move across the screen, adding dynamic motion to a webpage. 
             Maintaining a consistent and appealing image marque is essential for businesses to stand out in competitive markets. 
             A strong brand image not only enhances visibility but also communicates values and professionalism, making it a critical component of effective branding strategies in both digital and traditional media.</p>
